## Problem 1 -- Some Python `str` Basics


1. Let `a = "hello"` and `b = "world"`.  Use 
   `a` and `b` to produce `c = "hello world"`.
2. Figure out how to define `d = 'Hello World'` starting with `c`.
3. From `d`, define \texttt{e = ``Hello''} and  \texttt{f = ``World''}
   in a single line of code.
4. Let  `g = 123; h = 3.141592653589793; i = 6.022e23`.  Using those 
   values, produce `j = '123|3.1416| 6.02e+23'` in just one line.
5. Let `k = 5` (or some other integer).  Use that to produce 
   `l =  '0..1..2..3..4'` in just one line.
