# ME 701 - HW 3

Instructions:  For this homework, you will modify this `README.md` file.
Follow the individual problem instructions.

## Problem 1 -- Going to War

I came across [Code Wars](www.codewars.com) a few years back and thought it
was pretty fun.  Basically, it turns coding into a game that, unsurprisingly,
gets harder every time you "win."  

You are to sign up at [Code Wars](www.codewars.com).  If it gives you the
option, consider joining me ([robertsj](https://www.codewars.com/users/robertsj))
and the K-State clan.  

**Replace `robertsj` in [this link]([robertsj](https://www.codewars.com/users/robertsj) with your user name.**

## Problem 2 -- Mastery of the Python

When you first join Code Wars, you will start at the 8 kyu [beginner](https://www.codewars.com/docs)
level.  The challenges will start of easy (relatively, speaking) and get
harder.  I've done about 20 challenges and am at 5 kyu (a novice, haha).  For this
problem, you are to complete *at least* 6 challenges, one of which you will
select for Problem 3 (read that, too).  

List the six challenges below by using the appropriate URL, adding more
lines if you're the overachieving type:

  4.
  5.
  6.


## Problem 3 -- Reflecting on Debugging, Testing, and More

Choose one of the problems you listed above for the following tasks:

  1. Before you begin on any code, read the instructions for the problem and
     understand the "software requirements."  Are they good?  Are there gaps?
     Explain.
  2. Now, look at the starter code.  Is there any Python syntax that is not
     familiar to you?
  3. Look at the provided tests, which show (1) how the program (here, a single function) should be
     used and (2) how it should behave for certain cases.  Do these cases look complete?  
  4. Begin to code in the browser, or copy and paste into VS code (or your favorite editor).
     Remember, you can use the same sort of tests by using `unittest`.
  5. Develop your solution, test it, fix it, and repeat.  As you go along, describe what went wrong
     and, as you fix the bugs, why it went wrong.  By learning about our patterns of coding, we are
     better able to (1) prevent mistakes and/or (2) quickly recognize our mistakes.

## Problem 4 -- Complete the Anonymous Survey

Times are strange, and I believe we're all trying our best.  That said, efforts can always be
refocused, so I want to know how I can use my time better for you.  Or, if all is  
[hunky dory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunky_Dory_(disambiguation)), cool;
let me know that, too.
